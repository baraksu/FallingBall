the ball is rolling the down the stairs

==============================================

First I receive the values of the stair and the ball.

I calculated the number of times that stairs should be drawn on the screen.

I worte the stairs proc.

I called the proc number of time I calculated (mentioned above)

I entered the circle proc.

I gave data to the circle proc.

I draw a black circle on the white , in order to erase it.


In the future I would add an option to push a button and the ball will jump between the stairs.

The project was a positive experience, it was challenging and I beleive I succeeded.
