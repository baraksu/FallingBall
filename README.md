*the ball is rolling the down the stairs*

==============================================

## my work steps:

First I receive the values of the stair and the ball.

I calculated the number of times that stairs should be drawn on the screen.

I worte the stairs proc.

I called the proc number of time I calculated (mentioned above)

I entered the circle proc.

I gave data to the circle proc.

I draw a black circle on the white , in order to erase it.


## In the future
I would add an option to push a button and the ball will jump between the stairs.

## reflection

Its good to know that I have done and I was up to do this project.
